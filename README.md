# Project: Adolescent Relationships and Personality

### Objectives
- **Project Goal**:  
  To understand how internet use and emotional stability influence satisfaction in adolescent intimate relationships and explore the role of other factors, such as academic performance.

- **Research Question**:  
  How do internet use and emotional stability shape the quality of adolescents' relationships with family, friends, and romantic partners?

- **Research Gap**:  
  - Previous studies like Stavrova and Denissen (2021) explored the psychological outcomes of social media use but did not directly link this to satisfaction in close relationships.  
  - Donald et al. (2024) examined the interplay between internet use and adolescent relationships, but their scope did not include personality traits as a moderator.  
  - My research fills this gap by integrating personality and internet use as predictors and focusing on satisfaction within intimate relationships, providing a more nuanced understanding of these interactions.

### Approach
- **Dataset**:  
  The dataset used is **The National Survey of American Life - Adolescent Supplement (NSAL-A) (2001-2004)**, including 1,170 American adolescents aged 13-17.

- **Variables**:  
  - Emotional stability: Measured by seven items based on standard personality scales.  
  - Internet use time: A behavioral factor measuring hours spent online daily.  
  - Relationship satisfaction: A composite measure of satisfaction with family and friendships (romantic relationship data was excluded due to missing responses for this age group).

- **Data Collection**:  
  Data were collected through structured, face-to-face interviews covering mental health, internet use, personality traits, and relationships.

- **Analysis Method**:  
  Multiple regression was used to analyze the simultaneous effects of emotional stability, internet use, and academic performance on relationship satisfaction.

- **Key Results**:  
  - Emotional Stability: Adolescents with higher emotional stability tend to report lower satisfaction in their relationships.  
  - Internet Use Time & Academic Performance: Neither variable significantly influences relationship satisfaction.
  - Emotional stability’s negative association may reflect high self-expectations or low emotional adaptability in close relationships.  
  - The lack of impact from internet use challenges common stereotypes about its harmful effects on adolescent relationships.
    
### Impact
- **Significance**:  
  This research challenges stereotypes about internet use and highlights the importance of emotional well-being in adolescent relationships.

- **Practical Applications**:  
  - **Parents and Educators**: Better understand the role of personality in shaping adolescent relationships.  
  - **Policymakers**: Develop targeted interventions for adolescent emotional and social development.  
  - **Tech Companies**: Design guidelines or programs for healthy internet use based on personality traits. For example, social media platforms could tailor content recommendations to better suit users’ personalities.
